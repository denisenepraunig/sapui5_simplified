# Introduction

The application best practice guide will teach you the following:

* understand what bootstraping ins all about
* how to organize your folder structure
* understand how to use MVC (Model-View-Controller)
* build a Master-Detail app with the Split App control
* use different models for data, translation and device data
* how to navigate through the app with routing

In the whole guide the **sap.m (mobile)** library will be used. Mobile is not only for smart phones, it means responsive on all devices.
The views in the application will be declared via XML - but JS, JSON or HTML would also be possible.

> My personal optinion: after I got used to the XML view declaration I felt that it reads more natural than the definition via coding (JS) and I made lesser errors than trying it with JSON.
